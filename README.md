# kenghwee
A package where a meme becomes a reality.

## Description

As of now, the `kenghwee` package supports four things:

- `solution`: Living up the meme `from kenghwee import solution`
- `mission04`: You must be truly desperate to come to this for help...
- `rmrf`: `sudo rm -rf ~/`, goodbye!
- `cs1010s`: Very random, trust me
